Pre requisits: -Python 3.6.5 (script won't be convenient if your .py files are opened by an IDE such as pycharm so don't bother if you dont want to change this(!))
	       -An internet connection (can be installed without internet connection but wont update on startup)

This uses the google earth view images compiled by the creators of the extension there who kindly shared a list of the images they use on github.
This very simple script simply uses those links and sets windows backgrounds from the images.

If you dont want the background changing features of this application then I recommend Earthviewer on the microsoft store.
 
--INSTALLATION--
1. For those who don't have python, you can use this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lGhtIqT0Tk or just figure it out.

There are 2 ways you can use this script. You can either create a shortcut to it on your desktop and refresh the image when you please by running the shortcut
or you can have the script run on startup and change the background whenever you start up you computer. You can also do both.

2. Copy bgnlist1 and changebgrnd.pyw to a safe location, e.g a folder on your desktop or in your documents.

3. Right click changebgrnd.pyw and click create shortcut, a shortcut will appear.

4.1 if you want to be able to change the image on demand place this shortcut on your desktop (run it to change the background).

4.2 if you want the background to change on startup, press the windows key, type run, then in the new dialog that opens up, type
    shell:startup. This will bring up a windows explorer window, copy the shortcut into this folder for the script to run on startup.

Use at your own risk, tested on win 17134.472.
